# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# class1 = SchoolClass.create(title: "Coding 101", room_number: 1)
# class2 = SchoolClass.create(title: "Data Sci 101", room_number: 2)
# class3 = SchoolClass.create(title: "Food 101", room_number: 2)
# class4 = SchoolClass.create(title: "Children 101", room_number: 2)
